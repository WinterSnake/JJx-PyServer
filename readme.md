# Junk Jack X Server
This is a Python implementation of a Junk Jack X client/server. This was created by reverse engineering the packets as well as decompiling the game (this was how I found out it used the ENet library).
This is my attempt at learning a bit about reverse engineering game network protocols as well as creating a usable server to enhance the Junk Jack X Editor I created. Allows for dedicated server running - which is something the game does not allow you to do.

## Requirements
Requires pyenet to run.
